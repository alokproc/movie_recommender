Recommender systems attempt to recommend to users content that will be of some value. These systems are information filtering systems that can work by recommending content based on users' tastes (called collaborative filtering) or by recommending content based on the similarity of content (called content-based filtering).

Many sophisticated machine learning algorithms exist for recommender systems. Perhaps most famously, in 2009 Netflix awarded $1,000,000 for a movie recommender system that improved upon its own algorithm by over 10%. Though these algorithms exist, they are often beyond the reach of small and medium sized businesses. The goal of the project is to develop a recommender system that not only delivers improved performance compared to benchmark methods but can be easily implemented by small and medium sized businesses with limited computational capacity and resources.

This project will explore recommendation systems with a goal of developing a system that is both accurate and feasible to implement.
